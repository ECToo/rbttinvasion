= Introduction =

This page is a brief decription of the UTRBTTInvasion.ini file and how to configure it to your pleasing 
To the veteran players of ut2004 invasion the config of UT3 Invasion should be pretty straight forward to new players Welcome!

= Adding New Monsters =

as of revision 99 this is for instant action or servers using a seperate mutator to push thier custom content  

to add your own custom monsters first install your new packages 

UTRBTTInvasion.ini file 
http://images.allprog.nl/img/5565_1240350742.jpg

the data for each monster is held on its own monstertable line the line is broke down like this :

MonsterName="SkullCrab"    << the name of the monster (mainly for config intergration)

MonsterClassName="RBTTInvasion.RBTTSkullCrab"     <<the actual name of the pawns Class

MonsterClass=Class'RBTTInvasion.RBTTSkullCrab'  << As Above

any pawn can be added to UT3Invasion but if it's not using our AI the the pawn should spawn its own otherwise it'll just stand there.. failure to correctly specify the monsters or missing packages will hang your waves 

= Configuring The Waves =

the fist thing to understand is that ureal takes each of the monster table lines and assigns it a number starting at zero, this means in the table above the skullcrab is 0 and the infernal is 9

MonsterNum=(9,9,9,9) this is where you specify which omsters you want to spawn, the numbers represent the postion of the monster in the monster table this line will spawn all infernals, when invasion is in random spawn mode it picks mosters from the monsternum variable like a pool so if you had a line whch had, MonsterNum=(9,9,0,0) you would get a 50/50 split of skullcrab and infernals
