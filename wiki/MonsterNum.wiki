<table border=1 width=800>
<tr><td><b>MonsterNum</b></td><td>this is where you specify which mosters you want to spawn, the numbers represent the postion of the monster in the <b>MonsterTable</b> the first line in the <b>MonsterTable</b> above will spawn all infernals, when invasion is in random spawn mode it picks mosters from the <b>MonsterNum</b> variable like a pool so if you had a line whch had, MonsterNum=(9,9,0,0) you would get a 50/50 split of skullcrab and infernals</td></tr></table>
