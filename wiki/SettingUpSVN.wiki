Just follow the prompts and klik next (pretty simple)

= Installing The Classes =

now you've finnished installing tortoise open an explorer window and browse to 

C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3\UTGame\Src

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/9113_1240056031.jpg

Here you'll need to create a folder for your project called RBTTInvasion

Ok now to get some classes from the repository. Right klik in the rbbtinvasion folder and Select TortoiseSVN > Repo Browser

a window will popup asking for the url of your repository just enter

svn checkout http://rbttinvasion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rbttinvasion-read-only

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/6147_1240057655.jpg

Now Right Klik the the classes folder and select checkout 

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/8668_1240059146.jpg

when the checkout window appears you'll notice the URL of Repository field is already filled in for you,add a forward slash at the end of the line so it reads 

 http://rbttinvasion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/RBTTInvasion/Classes/

It is very important you add a forward slash or the files wil write out to the wrong place it should look like 

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/5543_1240059599.jpg

if you did everythig right this window will appear and you'll see the classes being downloaded to your machine :)

= Installing The packages =

Ok now its time to go get some packages open up an eplorer window again and browse to 

C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3\UTGame\Unpublished\CookedPC

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/4653_1240061770.jpg

again right klik in the folder select tortoiseSVN > Repo browser

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/8683_1240057034.jpg

the url window will appear again already filled in this time just klik ok 

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/6147_1240057655.jpg

this time when the repo browser appears you'll need to double klik on the RBTTInvasion folder to refresh the view. Then just right klik the packages folder and select checkout

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/3808_1240062875.jpg

again when the checkout window appears make sure you add a forward slash to the end of the URL of Repository field so it reads 

http://rbttinvasion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/RBTTInvasion/Packages/

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/713_1240063547.jpg

the packages take a little longer than the classes to download 

 http://images.allprog.nl/img/6145_1240060816.jpg

finally your directory should look like this
